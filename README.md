### AI Engineering, MLOPS, LLMOPS Cheat Sheets

I want to build a ML / LLM / neural net that specializes in solving partial differential equations and Einstein field equations and all manners of calculations related to general relativity. **From Scratch.**

I could program a neural net from scratch, but what are the exact steps. Or I could use a ready made LLM model and fine tune it to my curated set of sources and documents, again what are the exact steps involved. Are there any other more effective and powerful options?

**Here are the two main approaches and their relevant steps:**

### **1. Building a Neural Net from Scratch**
This allows full control but is more time-consuming.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Define the Problem Scope** – Specify the classes of PDEs, tensor equations, and numerical techniques.
2. **Choose a Framework** – PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
3. **Design the Network Architecture** – Options:
   - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (DeepXDE, Modulus)
   - Transformer-based architectures (for symbolic solutions)
   - Graph Neural Networks (for tensor-based problems)
4. **Prepare the Dataset** – Numerical solutions, symbolic derivations, analytic solutions from GR literature.
5. **Implement Training Pipeline** – Loss functions tailored for PDEs (e.g., residual loss for PINNs).
6. **Train and Optimize** – Use GPUs/TPUs, hyperparameter tuning.
7. **Validate Against Benchmarks** – Compare results with known solutions.
8. **Deploy and Scale** – Package as an API or integrate into a research workflow.

### **2. Fine-Tuning an Existing LLM**
Leverages pre-trained models (LLaMA, GPT-4, Mistral) for faster deployment.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Select a Base Model** – Choose a transformer-based LLM with math capabilities.
2. **Curate a Dataset** – Collect high-quality sources (textbooks, arXiv, Wolfram Alpha).
3. **Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Combine LLMs with a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma) for dynamic query resolution.
4. **Fine-Tune with LoRA or Full Training** – Use Hugging Face, DeepSpeed, or FSDP for efficient tuning.
5. **Train with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** – Improve equation-solving accuracy.
6. **Deploy and Evaluate** – API, CLI, or web interface for user interaction.

### **Alternative: Hybrid Approach (Probably Best Option?)**
1. **LLM for Symbolic Manipulations & Insights** – Fine-tuned on GR literature and PDE-solving techniques.
2. **Neural Network (PINN) for Numerical Solutions** – Specialized deep-learning model for approximations.
3. **Combine via API** – LLM generates equation reformulations, PINN handles numerical solutions.

**This hybrid method maximizes flexibility and accuracy.**

# **Focusing on the Hybrid Method:**
Here's a structured, step-by-step plan to implement the hybrid model:

## **Phase 1: Planning & Setup**
1. **Define the Scope & Use Cases**
   - List target PDEs (e.g., wave equation, Einstein field equations, Navier-Stokes).
   - Specify symbolic and numerical tasks.
   - Determine the required accuracy and latency.

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Choose cloud/local setup (AWS, GCP, local GPU cluster).
   - Install necessary libraries:
     - **LLM**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, DeepSpeed
     - **PINN**: TensorFlow, JAX, DeepXDE, NVIDIA Modulus
     - **Integration**: FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS/ChromaDB


## **Phase 2: LLM for Symbolic Manipulations**
3. **Select & Fine-Tune a Pretrained LLM**
   - Base model: LLaMA, Mistral, GPT-4 (via API), Falcon, or Mixtral.
   - Curate dataset (textbooks, arXiv, Wolfram Alpha, GR literature).
   - Fine-tune with LoRA on step-by-step derivations.
   - Evaluate using standard symbolic math benchmarks.

4. **Enhance LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Store curated research papers & solutions in FAISS/ChromaDB.
   - Implement search and context injection before inference.

5. **Integrate Reinforcement Learning (RLHF / Fine-Tuning Feedback Loop)**
   - Train LLM iteratively using user feedback on generated solutions.


## **Phase 3: Neural Network (PINN) for Numerical Solutions**
6. **Design & Train the PINN Model**
   - Select architecture (DeepXDE, Modulus, custom PyTorch model).
   - Prepare datasets with analytical and numerical solutions.
   - Implement loss functions:
     - Residual loss (∂u/∂t - Δu = f)
     - Data loss (against known solutions)
   - Train using GPU acceleration.

7. **Benchmark the PINN Model**
   - Compare against numerical solvers (Finite Element, Spectral Methods).
   - Optimize training with adaptive sampling and meta-learning.


## **Phase 4: Integration & API Development**
8. **Build an API for Hybrid Model**
   - Develop a FastAPI or Flask-based API.
   - Endpoint examples:
     - `POST /solve-symbolic` → Calls LLM for equation simplification.
     - `POST /solve-numerical` → Calls PINN for numerical results.
     - `POST /solve-hybrid` → Uses LLM + PINN together.

9. **Optimize for Performance & Scalability**
   - Deploy LLM model on Hugging Face Inference Endpoints / NVIDIA Triton.
   - Deploy PINN on TensorRT-optimized inference server.
   - Implement caching & batching for efficiency.


## **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment**
10. **Conduct Validation & Testing**
    - Compare against real-world solutions.
    - Iterate based on errors in both symbolic & numerical results.

11. **Deploy & Monitor**
    - Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow).
    - Collect feedback and iterate on model improvements.
